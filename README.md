# JAX-WS SOAP Web Service Client With Java 11 and Maven 

This project demonstrates how to generate a JAX-WS client with Java 11 and Maven 3. It does this using the Eclipse Metro
JAX-WS Maven plugin to generate web service artifacts that target the JAX-WS reference implementation.

on how it works.

## Requirements

* JDK 11 on path. (OpenJDK is fine)
* A recent Maven 3.

### Build

`mvn install`
